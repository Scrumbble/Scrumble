## What's the Idea? üí°
We are building a platform specifically for developers and designers starting from Freelancers, Solopreneurs, Product Designers, UX Engineers, Design System leaders, Developers, UX Writers, Scrum masters to Agile teams who can build portfolios, document their design/development stories, learnings, case studies, API documentation, and basically anything geeky which can be used for personal use or can be shared publicly in a clutter free environment. All the activities you do in Scrumbble remains under your sub-domain which can be easily showcased and can be connected to a custom domain for free. Scrumbble is a new place for networking, building portfolios, writing documentation receive feedback, and make good connections.
## The Pain Point : üòì
People don't see portfolios as a business tool! And they don't know what recruiters look for in a portfolio. To stand out we need a different way. And sharing our creative process is the key! But not just this, we need feedback from the people.
Have you ever tried asking questions or help in online communities (Slack, WhatsApp, Facebook or Telegram groups) and never got any help? Maybe people are busy, maybe they don't get any benefits for their contributions, maybe they have answered the same question many times and not interested to answer it again. So we need to make it more accessible for all the community members.
We lack a good community where people not just express their creativity, but they need to see the results of their creativity, receive feedback, and adjust in turn.
Another problem while doing anything worthwhile on the web, is that spammers of all shapes and sizes will eventually come out of the woodwork.
## How might we solve this? ü§î
One way to increase participation and engagement is by gamifying online communities. When anyone asks/posts any sort of questions it should be gamified so that members can get rewarded or recognitions for their contributions. Another way would be to make all the questions and answers that has been discussed should be accessible.
When a particular thread gets too many views or seems to be helpful for everyone then that can be added to the common Knowledge Base. With every question threads there will be an archive/bookmark option which will be archived to your own personal Knowledge Base and it if that gets archived by too many users it will be added to the common Knowledge Base.
## Gamification done right! ü§û
### Core Drive 1: Epic Meaning & Calling 
We are familiar with the fact that people don‚Äôt contribute to Wikipedia to make money, but they don‚Äôt even do it to pad their resumes. People contribute to Wikipedia because they believe they are protecting humanity‚Äôs knowledge ‚Äì something much bigger than themselves.
### Core Drive 2: Development & Accomplishment
Development & Accomplishment is our internal drive for making progress, developing skills, achieving mastery, and eventually overcoming challenges. The word ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù here is very important.
### Core Drive 3: Empowerment of Creativity & Feedback
It is expressed when users are engaged in a creative process where they repeatedly figure new things out and try different combinations. People not only need ways to express their creativity, but they need to see the results of their creativity, receive feedback, and adjust in turn. This is why playing with Lego and making art is intrinsically fun. If these techniques are properly designed and integrated to empower users to be creative, they often become Evergreen Mechanics.
